You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure
below.

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/CassieKoelsch/On-Boarding.git
    $ cd On-Boarding
    $ npm install

## Start & watch

    $ npm run start

## Simple build for production

    $ npm run build

## Update sources

Some packages usages might change so you should run `npm prune` & `npm install` often.
A common way to update is by doing

    $ git pull
    $ npm prune
    $ npm install

To run those 3 commands you can just do

    $ npm run pull
